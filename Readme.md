## Testing modules with side effects

Node.js and Jest will cache modules you `require`. To test modules with side effects youâ€™ll need to reset the module registry between tests:

```js
const modulePath = '../module-to-test'

afterEach(() => {
  jest.resetModules()
})

test('first test', () => {
  // Prepare conditions for the first test
  const result = require(modulePath)
  expect(result).toMatchSnapshot()
})

test('second text', () => {
  // Prepare conditions for the second test
  const fn = () => require(modulePath)
  expect(fn).toThrow()
})
```

## Usage with Babel and TypeScript

Add [babel-jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/babel-jest) or [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest). Check their docs for installation instructions.
